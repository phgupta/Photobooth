# Photobooth

ECS189H Photobooth Project
Part1 and Part2

# Part1
This is a simple web application that allows users to upload photos, label photos, and favorite them. 

# Part2
Continuation of part one, with the integration of Google Cloud Vision APIs to annotate the image with labels generated by the API.

# Note: 
User cannot add more than ten labels per image.
To use this project, you must use your own Google Cloud API key. 
Replace this line with your own key in Part2/server.js:
``` var Your_API_Key = ''; ```
